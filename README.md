This is the **TASK-04** of my internship at  Skill Craft Technology.

The task I got is to build a real-time hand gesture recognition model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. With this, I'll be able to understand more about this field and create my own program that fits the data that I have.

  
This project uses the [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/leapgestrecog)

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository.
